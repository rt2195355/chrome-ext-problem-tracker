# Chrome Extension – AZ Problem Tracker

This is a Chrome extension I made to help track and manage coding problems in AZ website that I’ve solved or want to revisit later. It has a clean popup UI and is easy to customize. I built it for personal use, but it can be a good starting point if you want to make your own Chrome extension.

- Simple and modular codebase
- Local storage-based data tracking
- DOM interaction example
- Easy to modify and extend

## Requirements

- Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with the Chrome Extensions API

### Tools

- Text Editor / IDE (e.g., VS Code)
